## VUSTOM

Vustom is a UI toolbox with modern design based on Vue 3. Inspired by a lot of CSS frameworks such as Bulma and Materialize, Vustom wants to be a 100% customizable package.

- No icons library mandatory, you can choose whatever icons you want.
- No branded variables, give it your own brand
- Easy syntax, BEEM convention, readable class names

Inspired by Vuetify, Buefy and co. All concurrents ofc !
